This Folder consists of Research support and enables researchers to change Channel Estimation algorithms in python code and compare with the algorithms present in srsRAN version 24_10.
This folder consists of 2 files one is algorithm in python and comparing between srsRAN algorithm or 5G standard algorithm.
The other file is c++ implementation of Channel estimation algorithm in srsRAN where it is been modified in line numbers 59 - 106 (Collection of data variables to send it to socket to process from socket in python).
THen this function is called in function preprocess_pilots_and_cfo refer line number 540 - 616
